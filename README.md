This folder contains two Jupyter notebooks:
-	Data_generator.ipynb
-	Verify_HCH.ipynb

Data_generator.ipynb generates students, disadvantaged and advantaged, with:
-	Complete preference lists
-	A random lottery number
-	A SHSAT score sampled from a Gaussian distribution with parameters given in input
The data is then stored in data.xls

Verify_HCH.ipynb takes in input student information in the form generated by Data_generator.ipynb as above and runs the algorithms MR, JSA, Base, DISC.

It can be used to verify that the HCH hypothesis is verified for:
-	Student scores sampled from a Gaussian that well-approximates the real score of disadvantaged (resp., non-disadvantaged) studes, see the discussion at the end of Chapter 3;
-	Real capacities of schools;
-	Quotas of 20%, which aligns with the quotas set by the NYC DOE.
